# 32-bit Processor
## Overview
This is a semester long project to design and implement a 32-bit RISC processor base on the Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The design implementation consists of a Harvard memory architecture separating storage and signal paths for both the instruction and data memory. An finite state machine control unit to manage the instruction cycle; fetch, decode, and execute. An integer datapath to handle all arithmetic and logical operations. Implemented a barrel shifter to handle logical shifts and added an enhancement to specify a shift amount. Added an interrupt implementing handshaking to handle I/O requests from an I/O memory.
